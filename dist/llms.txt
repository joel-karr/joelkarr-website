## Book: Don't Think When You Code

A book about the craft of software engineering in the AI era, coming Summer 2026. Drawn from 20+ years of experience building high-performing teams, surviving production disasters, and learning that mastery comes from deliberate practice.

The book is organized into three parts:
- Part 1: The Craft of Software Engineering
- Part 2: Leading Engineering Teams
- Part 3: The Path to Engineering Leadership

## ARC Methodology

ARC is a methodology for AI-era software development where the bottleneck is not typing speed but whether you are solving the right problem. It shifts focus from maximizing output to maximizing outcomes.

The six steps of ARC are:
1. Opportunities: Start with valuable outcomes, not feature requests
2. Ventures: Parallel work streams owned end-to-end by a single engineer
3. Task Templates: Shorthand for common task groups containing interfaces, objects, and tasks
4. Team Review: Review expensive-to-change design decisions, then trust the engineer
5. Build and Test: Engineers build with AI-assisted tools, test incrementally
6. Measure: Evaluate ventures against success metrics and feed insights back

## GW Tech

GW Tech is a technology community founded by Joel Karr in 2016. It connects software engineers, engineering leaders, and technologists passionate about innovation and software craft.
